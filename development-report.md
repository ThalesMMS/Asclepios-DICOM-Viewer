# Development Report – 16 Oct 2025

## Overview
Over the past iteration the DICOM ingestion and rendering pipeline was reworked to remove the dependency on `vtkDICOMReader` and use DCMTK directly. This refactor touched both the core data layer and all 2D/3D viewing widgets so that every component consumes the new `DicomVolume` abstraction.

## Key Changes
- Introduced `DicomVolume`/`DicomVolumeLoader`, which read single-frame and multi-frame datasets via DCMTK, populate pixel buffers, geometry (origin, spacing, orientation), window/level metadata, and expose the data through `vtkImageData`.
- Updated the core `Image`/`Series` models to surface `DicomVolume` instances instead of `vtkDICOMReader` handles.
- Reworked the rendering stack (`vtkWidget2D`, `vtkWidgetDICOM`, MPR maker, 3D widget) to operate on the volume abstraction, propagate metadata to overlays, and keep HU computations in sync.
- Retired all direct calls to `setImageReader/getImageReader`, and replaced transformations (flip/rotate/invert) with actor/camera operations that keep overlays and zoom factors consistent.
- Added missing VTK includes (`vtkDataArray`, `vtkInformation`, `vtkInteractorStyleImage`) required by the new code paths.

## Current Build Status
Compilation makes it through the core library but currently fails when linking the GUI executable because `vtkWidget2D::applyTransformation` still has outstanding references in other translation units. The new implementation has been added, yet the linker is still flagging the symbol – the fix is underway but not confirmed by a clean build yet.

## Follow-Up Tasks
1. Re-run the full `msbuild` after verifying the new `applyTransformation` symbols are picked up; adjust any additional references that still assume the old reader-based API.
2. Replace the direct flip/rotate stubs with geometry-aware transforms if higher fidelity orientation handling is required (e.g., resampling instead of actor scaling).
3. Run end-to-end QA once the executable links successfully: load series, exercise 2D scrolling, window/level, transformations, MPR, and 3D rendering to confirm functional parity with the previous pipeline.

## Notes
- The repository still contains older third-party directories (`deps/dcmtk`, `deps/vtk`, `deps/vtk-dicom`, `deps/vstools*`). They are not modified by this change set but remain untracked in the working tree.
- `solucao.md` has been removed from source control; confirm whether it should be restored or permanently deleted.
